        Hey all, I am Jen and welcome to my own space on the internet where I promote positivity and wellbeing around the internet.  I get my energy most days from the hour a day in the morning I spend on my mindfulness and my body. In the evening I am usually doing something creative, wether that be coding, painting or sketching. I have a love for Burritos and mexican food that burns deep into my soul - I have unashamedly watched "Taco Chronicles" on Netflix 3 times. I hope to inspire people into being more comforable in their own skin, be proud of who they are and become the best version of themselves.

    <h2>
      About Me!
    </h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      I am from a town called Solihull just south of the industrial powerhouse that is Birmingham. I love to be out in nature hiking and making memories with my ageing border collie, Molly. People sometimes describe me as a powerhouse, but I am most often found looking after people or becoming a more mindful and creative person. 
    </p>

      I was born with a cleft lip and growing up I spent many years wishing I wasnt inflicted with this 'thing'.  From the harsh words when I was young that friends and even teachers would say to me to the things that colleagues and bosses have said to me over the course of the last 30 years. This caused me to become depressed and in all honesty I wasn't living life to the fullest I felt like I was just exisiting in a world that didn't want me.
      </p>
    </div>
    
   <p>
     This all changed for me in 2014, I was working at a job where the boss decided that I wasn't capable of my job and even wrote to my doctor to try and find out "what was wrong with me".  They obviously never replied to her request. Then one warm summer afternoon, Christmas came early.  I had the opportunity to apply for a foundation course at Sheffield University. I handed in my 1 weeks notice.  That weekend I made an application, by the following week I had gone to Sheffield for an interview, and the week after I was moving.  Yes it was a gamble but it was a gamble I had to take.

      I had a new life, in a little green city called Sheffield where I could be who I was inside.  This became a turning point where I found that nobody cared how I looked. I was so happy in Academia I was happy to be only 20 mins from one of the most beautiful national parks England has to offer.  Geography felt like my true calling, learning about people and populations is something that inspires me to this day. I needed to learn. I needed to be at a place in my head and heart where I could learn and be free, and Sheffield was that.

      Fast forward to 2018, I had graduated and I was ready to take on the world.  I joined a small tile company, the people were really pleasant and I fitted in well.  I started my career at this company thinking this is all I need. By autumn 2019 I had met my soul-mate who has inspired me to grow and become even better than I was before.  in 2020 the global Covid-19 pandemic began and I was made redundant, I was thown out into the cold by a company that I thought I was going to be with for a while.

   During this pandemic I realised I had wasted the last few years, I wasnt growing, I wasnt trying to better myself I was just existing - I guess old habits die hard.  I decided that I was going to learn how to code.  I had dabbled in coding previously, through myspace where my love for Good Charlotte really shone through, sadly I think this page is long gone and it's probably for the best.  I joined "She Codes" and "Code First Girls" for short courses into web developemnt giving me the skills I need to be bigger and better.

   Geography and the environment will always remain a huge part of who I am.  I love the world I live in, I love the people in it too.
